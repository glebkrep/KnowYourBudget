## _WIP_ KnowYourBudget
Budgeting android application made for personal use and convenience, since none of the apps on the market fill my needs.

### __v0.3 release:__
__Disclaimer:__ Second version is _slightly_ buggy and is being made for personal use mostly.
```
Raw application with basic functionality neaded to benefit from the app.
- User-input expenses and budget
- At the moment it could be difficult to understand how to use app properly, but it will be fixed soon
- List of expenses with current balance
- Adding to total balance, spending balance on any expence
- List of transactions with ability to revert them
- Changing any expenses' budget
- Displaying current total balance 
- Fancy UI

```


#### Roadmap:
