## _WIP_ KnowYourBudget
Budgeting android application made for personal use and convenience, since none of the apps on the market fill my needs.

### __v0.1 release:__
__Disclaimer:__ First version is _really_ buggy and is being made solely for personal use.
```
Raw application with basic functionality neaded for me to benefit from it.
- Working with pre-defined expenses and budget (no user input here), which makes app practically useless for anyone except me
- List of expenses with current balance
- Adding to total balance, spending balance on any expence
- List of transactions with ability to revert them
- Changing any expenses' budget
- Displaying current total balance 
```


#### Roadmap:
- User input stable income, expense items
- Understandable controls
- Performance improvements
- Tests
- Making app more robust
- Saving data in cloud
- Accounts (?)
- Onboarding (?)
- Icon
- Design (icons, screens, etc)
