## Project is abandoned for an undetermined amount of time

## _WIP_ KnowYourBudget
Budgeting android application made for personal use and convenience, since none of the apps on the market fill my needs.

### __v0.3 release:__
__Disclaimer:__ Current version is _really_ buggy and was made for personal use mostly.
```
Raw application with basic functionality neaded to benefit from the app.
- User-input expenses and budget
- At the moment it could be difficult to understand how to use app properly, but it will be fixed soon
- List of expenses with current balance
- Adding to total balance, spending balance on any expence
- List of transactions with ability to revert them
- Changing any expenses' budget
- Displaying current total balance 
- Fancy UI
- Application Icon
- Import/Export application data
- Transfering money from expense to LOM
```


#### Roadmap:
- Make import/export format less human-readable
- Understandable controls
- Performance improvements
- Tests
- Making app more robust
- Saving data in cloud
- Accounts (?)
- Onboarding
- Publishing to GP
